# Hello ! 70kY Here

There's not much to talk about. These are the informations you might be looking for :

## Languages

* **C++** : started learning this a few years back now.
It's the language I'm the most confortable with.
* **Lua** : the first scripting language I learned.
Even though it is a bit limited, it also offers lots of possibilities, and I can still find myself looking back to it now and then.
* **LaTeX** : my go to tool when it comes to document production.
* **Python** : just some basic knowledge.
I plan to go more in depth with this language in the future for it's applications in data science.

## Aspirations / Interests

* **Game development** : my main goal. As I started my coding journey with C++, I went with it and I'm in the process of choosing the libraries to pair it with.
Right now, I'm leaning toward SDL.
* **Data science** : I'm really interested in the data science field, and in particular everything related to AI and ML.
I'm hoping to be able to pair it with some of my future projects as well

## "Completed" projects

* **TODO** : finish something

## Current projects

* I'm currently working on an engine based on *SDL* to get my future graphic applications done.
It will also be taking advantage on the ECS as I find this system rather interesting. Once I finish my test project, I might create a public repository for it so that you can read its code and use it if you'd like to.

**PS**: I know there might be other projects similar to this one, but I'm not doing it to *reinvent the wheel*, I'm doing it for the comprehension and the experience.

## Where to contact me?

Nowhere for now. I should add something here later.
